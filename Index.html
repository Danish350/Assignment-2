    <h1>Hollywood Actors</h1>
    <h2>Leonardo Dicaprio</h2>
    <p>Few actors in the world have had a career quite as<span style="color:red">diverse as Leonardo DiCaprio's</span>. DiCaprio has gone from relatively humble beginnings, as a supporting cast member of the sitcom Growing Pains (1985) and low budget horror movies, such as Critters 3 (1991), to a major teenage heartthrob in the 1990s,...</p>
    <h2>Tom Cruise</h2>
    <p>In 1976, if you had told fourteen-year-old Franciscan seminary student<span style="color:red">Thomas Cruise Mapother IV that one day in the not too distant future he would be Tom Cruise</span>, one of the top 100 movie stars of all time, he would have probably grinned and told you that his ambition was to join the priesthood.</p>

    <h2>Chris Hemsworth</h2>
    <p>Hemsworth started his career by appearing in several television series. In 2002, Hemsworth starred in two episodes of fantasy television series Guinevere Jones as King Arthur, as well as making an appearance in soap opera series Neighbours and one episode of Marshall Law. The following year, he appeared in an episode of The Saddle Club. In 2004, Hemsworth auditioned for the role of Robbie Hunter in Australian soap opera Home and Away. He did not receive the part, but was subsequently recalled for the part of Kim Hyde. He moved to Sydney to join the cast, appearing in 171 episodes of the series.[11] He left the cast of Home and Away on 3 July 2007. Hemsworth later remarked that although he became more visible after Home and Away, his work on a soap opera did not earn him respect within the film industry.</p>
